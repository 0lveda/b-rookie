      <h2>THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER </h2>
      <p>Once upon a time, there was a busy ant who worked hard all summer collecting food.  A grasshopper saw the ant working and laughed, saying, "Why work so hard? Summer's long!"</p>
      <p> The grasshopper spent the whole summer singing and dancing. When winter came, the ant had lots of food stored away, but the grasshopper was very hungry and cold! </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Page 3 -->
    <div class="page">
	  <p>He had no food because he hadn't worked to save any. He learned a big lesson that day about working hard and saving for the future. From then on, he helped the ant collect food so he'd be ready for the next winter! Poor George the grasshopper!</p>
      <p>He was so hungry and cold in the winter because he spent all summer singing and playing instead of gathering food like the wise ant.  He was so sorry he didn't listen to the ant's advice.</p>
    </div>
	<div class="page">
      <p>He went to the ant's house and asked for help.</p>
	  <p>The kind ant shared some of her food, and George learned a very important lesson about working hard and being prepared!  He felt very thankful and promised to work hard next summer.</p>

      <h2>THE WIND AND THE SUN</h2>
      <p>The Wind and the Sun were having an argument about which of them was the stronger. They decided to settle the matter with a challenge: whoever could make a traveler remove his coat would be considered the stronger.
	  The Wind went first.</p>
      <p> It blew with all its might, trying to force the traveler to take off his coat. But the harder the Wind blew, the more tightly the traveler wrapped his coat around himself.</p>
	</div>
    <!-- Page 2 -->
    <div class="page">
	 <p>Then the Sun took its turn. It shone warmly and gently. Gradually, the traveler felt the warmth and, feeling comfortable, he took off his coat.</p>
     <p>The Sun smiled and said, "Gentleness and kindness are always stronger than force and fury."</p>

      <h2>THE LION AND THE MOUSE</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time, a big, sleepy lion was napping under a tree. A tiny mouse, being super silly, accidentally ran across the lion's nose! The lion woke up with a ROAR!  The scared mouse squeaked, "Please, forgive me!" </p>
      <p>The lion, even though he was HUGE and the mouse was tiny, felt sorry for the little mouse and let him go. </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Page 2 -->
    <div class="page">
      <p>The lion thought, "A tiny mouse?  How could that ever help me?" But guess what? Later, the lion got stuck in a hunter's net! He roared and roared, but couldn't get free.</p>
      <p>Then, who should scurry by but that same little mouse! The mouse chewed through the net, and the lion was free! 
	  The lion learned that even the littlest creatures can be super helpful, and that being kind is always a good idea! Wow!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="page">
      <p>The lion was in a BIG mess! He was all tangled up in a hunter's net, and he was trying to roar his way out, but it wasn't working. Then, guess who heard him?  That little mouse!  
	  Even though the mouse was tiny, she bravely started to chew through the ropes of the net.  Snip, snip, snip!  Soon, the lion was free! The lion was SO happy! </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="page">
	<p>He remembered how kind he'd been to the mouse before, and he was so grateful for her help.  
	He said, "You saved my life! We're friends forever!" And they lived happily ever after, proving that even small acts of kindness can make a HUGE difference!</p>

      <h2>THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF</h2>
      <p>A young shepherd boy, who was bored while watching his sheep, decided to cry out, "Wolf! Wolf!" even though there was no wolf. </p>
      <p>The villagers rushed to his aid, but when they arrived, they found that there was no wolf, and the boy laughed at having tricked them.</p>
	 
    </div>
    <!-- Page 2 -->
    <div class="page">
	 <p>Later, when a real wolf appeared and threatened his sheep, the boy again shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" But this time, the villagers did not believe him, thinking he was lying again. </p>
      <p>As a result, the wolf attacked the sheep, and the boy learned a harsh lesson.</p>
      <p>The moral of the story is: Liars are not believed, even when they tell the truth.</p>

      <h2>THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time, in a big green forest, 
	  there lived a speedy hare and a slow but steady tortoise. The hare loved to brag about how fast he could run. One day, he laughed at the tortoise and said, “I’m so fast, I bet you couldn’t beat me in a race!” </p>
      <p>The tortoise smiled and said, “Maybe not, but I’d still like to try.” So, they set a date for the big race! All the forest animals came to watch.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Page 2 -->
    <div class="page">
      <p>The squirrel, the owl, the deer—everyone was excited! When the race began, the hare zoomed ahead like lightning! He was so fast, the tortoise was left far behind.</p>
      <p>The hare looked back, laughed, and said, “I’ve got plenty of time. I think I’ll take a little nap.” Meanwhile, the tortoise kept moving—step by step, slow and steady. He didn’t stop or look back. He just kept going.</p>
    </div>
	
	  <div class="page">
      <p>While the hare snored under a tree, the tortoise passed him quietly. When the hare woke up, he stretched and looked around—and gasped! “Oh no! The tortoise is almost at the finish line!”</p>
      <p> He ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise crossed the finish line first! All the animals cheered for the tortoise. The hare was surprised, but he learned something important that day.
